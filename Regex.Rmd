## Assignment 4

First I read the dataset in using read.csv.

```{r}

MData <- read.csv("Data/measurements.csv")

```

Then, I used the dplyr package to create a new column for the dataset called "Sp", which contained only the first letter of the genus followed by a period and the species.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

MData <- mutate(MData, Sp= sub("\\B.+ ", ". ", Species))

MData.2 <- select(MData, Sp, Limb.Width, unitsW, Limb.Length, unitsL)

```
